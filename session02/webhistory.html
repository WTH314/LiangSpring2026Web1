    <h2>History of the Web</h2>

        <h3>EARLY 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>

        <p>In the 20th century, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine have that creative Mundaneum. The reason they are creative is that they want a place to store global information. Also, the beginning of the history of data collection and management was a precursor to the Internet. The Mundaneum was originally housed at the Cinquantenaire Place in Brussels. They had renamed it Palais Mondial before the Mundaneum was finalized. They have built the project in the Netherlands because of what happened at that time, which is the defect of the Austrian Social Democratic Party in the Austrian civil war. Then later in the year, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium, which led the Mundaneul being replaced with an exhibit of theird reich art, which led to some of the material being lost. The  Mundaneum.  Was reconstituted into a larger building in Leopold Park in 1972. Then it was move store in Wallonia in the 1930s.</p>

        <h3>1945, memex,vannevar bush </h3>

        <p>In 1945, memex was created by Vannevar Bush. Memex stands for a portmanteau of memory and index. Is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with a microform document. Bush's goal of making the Memex was to store and compress all the books and communication so it can be consulted with unprecedented speed and flexibility.  “Bush's 1945 'As We May Think" idea for the memex extended far beyond a mechanism that might augment the research of one individual working in isolation. In Bush's idea, the ability to connect, annotate, and share both published works and personal trails would profoundly change the process by which the "world's record" is created and used.” The Memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems and personal knowledge base software.  Also, they want the mechanical core of the desk to include "a mechanism which automatically photographs longhand notes, pictures, and letters, then files them in the desk for future reference. The Memex was never physically built, but it did influenced latter pioneers in computing. </p>

        <h3>1960s, project Xanadu"hypertext",Ted Neslson </h3>

        <p>Project Xanadu was an early hypertext project initiated by Ted Nelson in the 1960s. It aimed to create a universal library of interconnected documents that could be accessed and linked together in a non-linear fashion. The project introduced the concept of "hypertext," which allows users to navigate between related pieces of information through hyperlinks.Xanadu was unlike the World Wide Web, Xanadu was intended to allow for secure, permanent, and royalty-enabled content sharing, which Nelson views as superior to the, in his view, simplified, one-way links of the modern internet.Ted Nelson's vision in the 1960s was, and remains, an influential, alternative approach to organizing information, often called the "original, unfulfilled" vision of the web. Although Project Xanadu faced technical and financial challenges and was never fully realized, which it lead to the laid off the foundation for later hypertext systems, including the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h3>1960s, the birth of the internet APPANET</h3>

        <p>The ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern Internet. It was developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The ARPANET was designed to facilitate communication and resource sharing among research institutions and universities. It used a decentralized architecture and employed packet-switching technology, which allowed data to be broken into smaller packets and transmitted independently across the network. "The first successful host-to-host connection on the ARPANET was made between Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and UCLA, by SRI programmer Bill Duvall and UCLA student programmer Charley Kline."</p>

    <h3>1971, first email Ray Tomlinson</h3>

        <p>Ray Tomlinson is credited with inventing email in 1971. He developed the first networked email system while working on the ARPANET project. Tomlinson's innovation was to use the "@" symbol to separate the user's name from the host computer's name, creating the format we still use today for email addresses (e.g., user@host). His work laid the foundation for modern email communication, which has become an essential part of our daily lives. "The Internet Hall of Fame in its account of his work commented "Tomlinson's email program brought about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate." He is credited with the invention of the TCP three-way handshake which underlies HTTP and many other key Internet protocols."</p>

    <h3>1983, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn </h3>

        <p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols that form the foundation of the Internet. It was developed in the 1970s by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn. TCP/IP provides a standardized way for different computer networks to communicate with each other, allowing data to be transmitted across diverse networks seamlessly. The adoption of TCP/IP as the standard protocol for the ARPANET in 1983 marked a significant milestone in the development of the modern Internet.The early implementation "In November 1977, a three-network IP test was conducted between sites in the US, the UK, and Norway. Several other IP prototypes were developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983.A computer called a router is provided with an interface to each network. It forwards network packets back and forth between them Originally a router was called gateway, but the term was changed to avoid confusion with other types of gateways"</p>

    <h3>1989, Invention of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN ) </h3>

        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Berners-Lee proposed a system for sharing and accessing information over the Internet using hypertext, which led to the development of the first web browser and web server. The World Wide Web revolutionized the way information is shared and accessed, making it possible for users to navigate between linked documents using hyperlinks. It has since become a fundamental part of the Internet, transforming communication, commerce, and information dissemination worldwide."The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction."</p>

    <h3> 1990, Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER Tim Berners-Lee </h3>

        <p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the foundational technologies for the World Wide Web, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The URL provides a standardized way to identify and locate resources on the web, while HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting data between web servers and clients (browsers). HTML is the markup language used to create and structure web pages. Berners-Lee also created the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, which allowed users to access and navigate web pages. These technologies laid the groundwork for the modern web.some award and honours that he have get is" knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours"for services to the global development of the Internet"</p>

        <h3>1991, first website Tim Berners-Lee </h3>

        <p>The first website was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN. The website was hosted on a NeXT computer and provided information about the World Wide Web project, including details on how to create web pages and use the web. The URL of the first website was CERN, a research center in Switzerland and it marked the beginning of the public availability of the World Wide Web. The site served as a demonstration of the capabilities of the web and laid the foundation for the vast array of websites that would follow. like the "The World Wide Web Virtual Library is a website started as Tim Berners-Lee's web catalog at CERN. There is a snapshot of the site from November 1992 at Subject listing – Information by Subject" </p>

        <h3>1990 , The first search engine Alan Emtage Archie index </h3>

        <p>The first search engine, called Archie, was created in 1990 by Alan Emtage, a student at McGill University in Montreal. Archie was designed to index and search for files on FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers, which were commonly used for sharing files over the Internet at the time. The search engine worked by periodically downloading directory listings from public FTP servers and creating a searchable database of file names. Users could then query the database to find specific files. Archie laid the groundwork for later search engines that would index web pages and other online content. "The earliest versions of Archie would simply search a list of public anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites using the Telnet protocol and create index files available via FTP. To view the contents of a file, it had first to be downloaded. The indexes are updated on a regular basis (contacting each roughly once a month, so as not to waste too many resources of the remote servers) by requesting a listing. These listings were stored in local files to be searched using the Unix grep command."</p>

        <h3> 1992, The first photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee </h3>

        <p>The first photo on the Internet is believed to be an image of the band Les Horribles Cernettes, a parody pop group formed by CERN employees. The photo was taken by Silvano de Gennaro in 1992 and was uploaded to the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.Also their band  musical style is often described as "doo-wop. The initials of their name, LHC, are the same as those of the Large Hadron Collider, which was later built at CERN.Their humorous songs are freely available on their website." The image was shared as part of a demonstration of the capabilities of the web and is considered one of the earliest examples of digital images being shared online."</p>

        <h3>1997, The invention of Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 WIFI standard</h3>

        <p>Wi-Fi, based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, was first introduced in 1997. The development of Wi-Fi technology was driven by the need for wireless communication and networking. The IEEE 802.11 standard defined the protocols for wireless local area networks (WLANs), allowing devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without the need for physical cables. Wi-Fi has since become a ubiquitous technology, enabling wireless connectivity in homes, businesses, and public spaces worldwide. Also, the "base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had subsequent amendments. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote the capabilities of their products."</p>
