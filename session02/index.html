<h2>About me: Biography </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Yingxin Liang, and I am currently pursuing a degree in the Emerging Media major at Hunter College. I have a passion for being curious and the idea of knowing new things, and I enjoy exploring various aspects of web design and development. In my free time, I like to learn new ideas to create art or design. Also, I like to cook like look online to find something fun to make to eat. Also, I like to draw in my free time sometimes, and right now I'm trying to learn how to knit, so I also do that in my free time. I am excited to expand my skills in web production and creativity from the projects I'm going to do throughout the semester.
